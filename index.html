    <h2>About this page</h2>
    <p>This page (or personal project) is just something for me to do on my free time from school. So expect this page in particular to be filled with links to other pages that I created from inspiration. Like a page dedicated to a K-pop group I like, or about an Anime I've watched in the past.</p>

    <p><a href="newjeans.html">NewJeans</a> a K-pop girl group that is currently trending with their new songs!</p>
