# about-me

Hello!

This is a personal project for me to just code for fun when I have time from school to do this. 

I'll most likely write about things that I'm interested in. Currently, I'm making a page about the K-pop group NewJeans (뉴진스)! After their page is done, I'll work on another interest of mine and make a page dedicated to them. 

I hope that doing this will help me get use to Coding and using Git and GitHub.
